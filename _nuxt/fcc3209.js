During each weekend there is a schedule that may\n                      differ in terms of times.\n\n                      Recently I have seen a lot of positive tweets from the F1 Twitter community about F1 widgets.\n                      The widgets allow you to quickly see the schedule of the upcoming race weekend and view the\n                      championship standings between teams and drivers. Widgets can be placed on your phone's home\n                      screen so that you can get the information fast.
