                Bluebird Day develops webshops for clients. Bluebird Day wants to ensure each webshop is fitting and
                unique for their client. Bluebird Day often notices that the development time of just the basic
                parts of the webshops costs a occupies a big part of their time. Reusing basic parts of the webshops
                will allow the
                developers to work on the unique parts of each webshop.
