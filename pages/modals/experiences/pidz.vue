                <p>Together with a team of front-end developers I worked on the development of a new web platform and
                  maintained the existing app and web platform.</p>

                  <ul class="spacing list">
                    <li class="list-bullet">Helped shape a new way of working; previously the PIDZ development team were
                      not optimally making use of components. At the start of my employment at PIDZ, I noticed that
                      components
                      were often not reused properly or too specific to be used multiple times. As a team we worked on
                      setting up a component library with a set of rules/guidelines on how they should be used. I
                      suggested that we should apply an atomic design structure for the component library and
                      communicated with UX that they should adopt the same structure in their Sketch project so that UX
                      and Development would be working in the same flow.
                      <p>Now PIDZ can reuse their components across all their platforms reducing development time and
                        improving consistency.</p>

                    <li class="list-bullet">Helped build the new MijnPIDZ calendar; PIDZ wanted to renew their calendar
                      feature. The key aspects I developed are the responsivity of the calendar and adding
                      validation to the
                      calendar item forms. The majority of this page consists out of components from the component
                      library (e.g. the buttons, dropdowns, form fields and calendar items).</li>
