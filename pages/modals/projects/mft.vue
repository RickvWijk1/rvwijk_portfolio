              <p>
                Many amateur football coaches still use pen and paper to mark attendance
                and
                write down tactics. Some trainers don't even take notes.
                This medieval method is chaotic, unconvenient and takes too long.
                There's also trainers who take the training/matches a little too
                seriously or neglect them.
                Players often say nothing to the trainer about this, because they do not
                know any better
                or are afraid to tell the trainer.
