                <p>In order to be able to give PSV advice, there must first be investigated what the current ICT
                  architecture system that PSV uses for its media platforms looks like. Making an architecture diagram
                  will enable us to understand the current architecture better so that we can take it into account when
                  we design/redesign the app.</p>

                  article have to make to land up in the app viewable for users?</p>
                <p>I talked to our PSV contacts. They provided me with information about their software architecture.
                </p>
                <p><b>Workshop research was applied,</b> because an architecture diagram of PSV's current software
                  architecture would give a good overview of the situation. From this overview we could potentially
                  discover how we can improve the app or the system in general.</p>

              <p><b>Software Architecture Diagram</b></p>
              <p>The diagram below shows the flow of updating/maintaining the media platforms and what parties are
                involved in this process. Visio was used to create the diagram.</p>
              <p> After I created the diagram I found out about the C4 model. The C4 model is for mapping all kinds of
                entities that are involved in a software architecture system.
                My goal was to understand the current PSV software architecture as a whole, not a specific part. In
                regard to the C4 model, the diagram below shows Level 1 (Context), Level 2 (Containers) and Level 3
                (Component).
                For example, the 'PSV redactie' is part of the context, while the PSV app is a container and the Sports
                Alliance database is a component.

                  It was quite difficult to get a good overview of all the architecture entities. This is probably
                  because half the information that was given to me by PSV was through email paragraphs and the other
                  half was verbally given. Summing everything up with bullet points helped. After that it was a lot
                  easier to visualize everything into an architecture diagram. I also had to ask PSV some extra
                  questions. One of them was about the role of Simac since they're PSV's IT partner. Apparently Simac
                  only provided IT facilities to PSV and had nothing to do with the developing/maintaining of their
                  media platforms.
