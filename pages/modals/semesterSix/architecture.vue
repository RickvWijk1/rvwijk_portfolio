                <p>In order to be able to give PSV advice, there must first be investigated what the current ICT
                  architecture system that PSV uses for its media platforms looks like. Making an architecture diagram
                  will enable us to understand the current architecture better so that we can take it into account when
                  we design/redesign the media platforms.</p>

                  It was quite difficult to get a good overview of all the architecture entities. This is probably
                  because half the information that was given to me by PSV was through email paragraphs and the other
                  half was verbally given. Summing everything up with bullet points helped. After that it was a lot
                  easier to visualize everything into an architecture diagram. I also had to ask PSV some extra
                  questions. One of them was about the role of Simac since they're PSV's IT partner. Apparently Simac
                  only provided IT facilities to PSV and had nothing to do with the developing/maintaining of their
                  media platforms.
