                <p>For PSV this project is just the beginning of a bigger project. Our work will serve as inspiration
                  and push PSV in the right direction. PSV will want to take our advice, research and designs and
                  continue from
                  there.
                </p>
                <p>Right after the final presentation, it was time to reflect upon the project, as a project group, but
                  also with the client. By reflecting we can see what could have gone better and what went well so that
                  we can all learn from it.</p>

                <p><b>Field research was applied,</b> because by discussing the delivery with PSV, we understood what they
                  would like to see delivered and in what way is most convenient for them. PSV wanted to receive the
                  most important research documents, technical advice, and access to the code in GitHub and design
                  (prototypes) in Figma.
                  I suggested to send a zip file with WeTransfer (since email doesn't allow big files) which PSV agreed
                  to.

                  improvement and in what areas they're already strong.</p><p>The other project members gave feedback to me as well.</p>

                <p>The delivery of the project was quite straightforward, it wasn't as much of a hassle compared to my past projects. This is probably, because we had a lot of contact with PSV.
                  I liked doing the retrospective and giving peer feedback to each other, because it only takes a short amount of time to do, but helps improve yourself and the others.
