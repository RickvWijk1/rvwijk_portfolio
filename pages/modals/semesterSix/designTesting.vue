                <p>I expect the new design/notification system to provide more atmosphere/immersion for PSV fans, as the
                  new notification system lets users hear PSV music/tunes when they receive a notification and
                  notifications show images of the match. Fans always hear these music/tunes when they're at the
                  stadium and the music will therefore evoke passionate emotions.</p>

              <h3>Design choices</h3>
              <p>During the wireframing and high-fidelity process I applied basic design principles/guidelines and the
                branding guidelines of PSV. The basic principles/guidelines were; menu layouts, icons, content alignment
                and content management. The applied branding guidelines were; typography, color palette, icons.
                These were applied since the current users of PSV are used to the style which is positive for the user
                experience. Figma
                was used to create the designs below.</p>
              <p>The only element that wasn't used in PSV's style guide, is the slider. The slider provides an
                explanation on how to add custom tunes. This was added, because users have to perform actions outside
                the app, which means we can't assist the user once they exit the app.</p>

                  It was crucial to test the prototype. I feel like I should have made the testing goal/plan smaller. I
                  made a big test plan, because I wanted to see how PSV fans would experience my entire prototype and
                  not just a very small part. Next time I will make sure to start small or much earlier so that I will
                  have enough time to execute the plan.

              <p>All the research and products that are useful to PSV need to be transferred in an efficient way.
                Alongside the delivery of these products, advice will be given to PSV.
                After the final presentation, we will reflect upon the project with PSV and finally the whole project
                group by giving peer feedback.
