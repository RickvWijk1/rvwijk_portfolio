                  A minimum of 5 interviews will be held and a minimum of 20 survey results will be collected. The
                  results will be noted down and a conclusion will be written based on the results.

                race weekends fully per season (‘fully’ means they watch free practice and qualifying sessions as well
                as the race itself) and have Android smartphones. For the interviews and survey Formula 1 fans that
                don’t use Android can still participate.</p>
