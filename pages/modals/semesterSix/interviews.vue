                  the PSV app to read/view PSV news. The website is most likely used for the same purpose, but it's most important function is being able to buy

                A mobile app is most valuable to have when you're not at home behind your desk. For this
                reason we selected the loyal/more hardcore PSV fans as our target
                audience. These type of fans often go to the Philips Stadium to watch a game. An app
                that can save your ticket so that you can scan it at the stadium's entry is useful for the
                target audience. Other features like 'Games' that focus on a young target audience are more
                convenient to use on the PSV website or develop natively in a separate app instead of the web-views
                PSV uses.

                  Talking to PSV was essential since they, as experts, have gathered a lot of data about their target
                  audiences. Getting this information was the starting point for picking a target audience for the
                  design challenge. What also helped was that PSV is looking for future-proof features that mainly
                  involves the PSV stadium. This made it easier to make the target audience more concrete. Interviewing
                  the target audience gave us an understanding of what they
                  need and how the PSV app can help them.
