                    <h2>Approach</h2>
                    <p>During the project we worked with Trello. In Trello we worked Scrum; meaning we would post
                      tasks/activities that needed to be undertaken for each sprint and when the tasks/activities were
                      completed we reviewed each other's work. Reviewing often happened during the stand-ups (Monday and
                      sometimes Wednesday morning) which were online via MS Teams. On Tuesday we met on location to
                      discuss and/or review work. On Thursday we each worked individually on our portfolio. Friday was
                      often working from home individually.</p>

                          <p>After the scoping of the project, we assigned a specific user story to each project
                            member to work on. I decided to apply the Design Thinking method, because it's a very
                            flexible method where you can start with prototyping if needed and then go back to a
                            phase that normally would be explored earlier (e.g. empathizing). I predicted that I would
                            probably have to make POC's early on to explore the technical possibilities for my user
                            story so using Design Thinking would be a safer option than the less flexible Waterfall
                            method for example.</p>

                          <p>PSV is a Dutch sports club and is mainly known as a football club. PSV wants to offer its
                            fans
                            and followers a good and relevant experience on every device and at any time. PSV currently
                            has
                            a website and two native apps to provide this.</p>

                        <div class="project-body">
                          <p>Technological developments are moving fast and there are now countless possibilities for
                            setting up digital platforms. Setting up and maintaining a custom-built app
                            requires a relatively large amount of work and investment, because you have to develop
                            everything separately for android and ios. At the same time, the possibilities of mobile
                            websites are increasing. This all lead PSV to wonder how PSV can best organise its digital
                            platforms with regard to what they want to offer fans and followers.</p>

                          <p>The main goal of the project is to make the PSV app more valuable to PSV fans in a
                            future-proof way. PSV originally wanted to let us research what technologies a new PSV app
                            should use. In addition, we (the project group) saw an opportunity to also research and
                            redesign some of its most
                            attractive/valuable features/concepts so that more value could be added to the PSV app in

                              href="https://rickvwijk1.github.io/rvwijk_portfolio/modals/semesterSix/projectPlan">debriefing</a>
                            meeting we mainly listened to what the client had to say. PSV told us
                            that developing and maintaining their website and apps costs a lot of money. Mainly their
                            iOS and Android apps which are developed by a third party. They would like a cheaper
                            solution to bring PSV fans the content & functions they need.</p>
                          <p>Based on the information from the debriefing, me and Dary, created the first version of the
                            <a class="txt-link" target="_blank"
                              href="https://rickvwijk1.github.io/rvwijk_portfolio/modals/semesterSix/projectPlan">project
                              plan</a>. When we were defining the project plan, we began to doubt whether this
                            assignment was fiting for ICT & Media Design students since the client specifically asked
                            for a cheaper technical solution and nothing that had something to do with users.</p>
                          <p>We arranged two more meetings with PSV to see if we could reformulate the assignment and
                            define the scope. In this
                            meeting PSV told us that they were busy concepting new features for the app, like being able
                            to scan tickets, order food during a game and more. They didn't want us to work on these
                            features, but we suggested that we would do technical research and also design the features
                            PSV were working on so that they could perhaps draw inspiration from our ideas/designs. PSV
                            agreed and so we adjusted the project plan.</p>

                          <p>While we were waiting for meetings with PSV to update the project plan, we were doing
                            research on the current situation. I did research on what entities the architecture of PSV's
                            media platforms consisted of. This would help give us an overview on what could be improved
                            while keeping into account the existing software architecture (e.g. API's) and stakeholders.
                            Information about PSV's architecture was collected by talking to PSV and doing additional
                            desktop research (e.g. researching what the API's were capable of). This information was
                            used to create a <a class="txt-link" target="_blank"

                          <p>PSV's current apps target PSV fans of any age. The apps have lots of features/sections like
                            games, augmented reality, videos, the fanstore and more. A lot of these sections are loaded
                            into a web
                            view which is very user unfriendly like we experienced when we were using the app. This is
                            why we decided to only work on features that would add real value to PSV fans.
                            A mobile app is most valuable to have when you're not at home behind your desk. For this
                            reason we selected the loyal/more hardcore PSV fans as our <a class="txt-link"

                              audience</a>. These type of fans often go to the Philips Stadium to watch a game. An app
                            that can save your ticket so that you can scan it at the stadium's entry is useful for the
                            target audience. Other features like 'Games' that focus on a young target audience are more
                            convenient to use on the PSV website rather than the app.</p>

                            audience (loyal/more hardcore fans) and interviewed them to gain insight in what their
                            annoyances/struggles/goals/needs are.
                            Some of the insights are: PSV fans often share their season ticket with family and friends,
                            PSV fans like to have visual context when they're following a game via the app since they're
                            often confused about what's happening.

                      what frustrations/goals/needs they had. Based on this information, user stories were formulated

                          <p>Max formulated most of the user stories. Each project member picked out one or two user
                            stories that they wanted to work on.</p>
                          <p>I decided to work on the user stories: "As a user I want to receive notifications on my
                            phone so that I can get realtime updates from the club" and "As a user I want to assign
                            tunes to notifications so that I know what kind of notification I received before I have
                            even seen them". I reformulated these user stories into one since the first one was too
                            generic and not
                            concrete while the other was too limited.</p>
                          <p>
                            The new user story became: "As a PSV fan I want to receive notifications that give a more
                            clear context when something
                            happens that's related to a (PSV football) game so that I can keep up with what's happening
                            and be more invested in the game".

                              of action</a>, I formulated a fitting main research question and design challenge: "How
                            can I
                            make the PSV fans feel more immersed through notifications?", "Design a notification system
                            for PSV
                            fans that follow games via the PSV app which allows them to get a more clear context of
                            what's happening in a game so that they become more immersed/invested into the game."
                          </p>
                          <p>The reason I picked up this user story, is because PSV fans I interviewed stated that they
                            sometimes don't know what's going on when there's a complicated situation in a game and are
                            relying on textual notifications. They feel like they're missing information and feel the
                            need for visual context (a video or images). This includes the PSV app, but also other

                        <h3>Researching PSV's notification system</h3>
                        <div class="project-body">
                          <p>My first research for the user story was <a class="txt-link" target="_blank"
                              href="https://rickvwijk1.github.io/rvwijk_portfolio/modals/semesterSix/userstories">researching
                              the current notification system of
                              PSV's app</a>. The main question was to research what the notifications system looks like,
                            meaning how it works on a technical level and what it
                            looks like from the user's perspective. I learned what design was used to display
                            notifications and the notification settings by using the app for several weeks. This gave me
                            a good understanding of the user experience and how much the notification system contributes
                            to the immersion/game experience. One time
                            during a game, I didn't get any notifications at all from the app despite notifications
                            being enabled. This was solved by reopening the app, but another issue occured later on when
                            I received a few
                            notifications in the wrong order. The issue might have been my phone or network's fault
                            though since it
                            never happened again. </p>

                          <p>By talking
                            to PSV I also discovered that the
                            Gracenote API checks for a change in the database every minute and if something in the
                            database updates (for example a goal has been scored) it outputs the data to a
                            notification.
                            This means that the delay of notifications can take a whole minute, which is way longer
                            compared
                            to football score apps I tried out later on.</p>

                        <h3>Trend analysis football score apps</h3>
                        <div class="project-body">
                          <p>While I was researching PSV's notification system, I also started trying out other <a
                              class="txt-link" target="_blank"
                              href="https://rickvwijk1.github.io/rvwijk_portfolio/modals/semesterSix/userstories">football
                              score apps</a> that were popular and had good reviews. This way I could compare the
                            notification
                            systems with PSV's notifications system and see how other apps create immersion/atmosphere
                            through the use of notifications. The goal, therefore, is to understand how other football
                            apps create more immersion/atmosphere around games for their users with the use of
                            notifications.</p>
                          <p>To start off the research I looked at the notification options for each of the football
                            score apps and enabled everything match related. During the next few weeks I received
                            notifications of
                            games. Something valuable I found is that the Feyenoord app was posting realtime photo's of
                            the game and lots of other visuals on a timeline. When you would click on a notification it
                            would bring you to that timeline so I felt like I was getting good context on what was
                            happening and enjoyed seeing images of the crowd enjoying themselves. Even before and after
                            the game they would post photos of players, fans, the stadium. If I was a Feyenoord fan I
                            would have most likely gotten very excited for the game so this could be a good addition for
                            improving the immersion of the PSV app.</p>
                          <p>One of the other apps I tested posted images in notifications which helps give more context
                            which on itself can increase the immersion. Most apps also offered notifications about when
                            the match would start, what the squad formation would be and when a penalty was given.
                            Penalties are a great way to build suspense since there's a high chance of a goal being
                            scored.</p>
                            <p>The trend analysis gave me a lot of inspiration for making a prototype.</p>
