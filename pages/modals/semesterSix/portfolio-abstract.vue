                    <h2>Approach</h2>
                    <p>During the project we worked with Trello. In Trello we worked Scrum; meaning we would post
                      tasks/activities that needed to be undertaken for each sprint and when the tasks/activities were
                      completed we reviewed each other's work. Reviewing often happened during the stand-ups (Monday and
                      sometimes Wednesday morning) which were online via MS Teams. On Tuesday we met on location to
                      discuss and/or review work. On Thursday we each worked individually on our portfolio. Friday was
                      often working from home individually. Google Drive was used to store all our research work and a
                      GitHub organization was created to manage code.</p>

                          <p>After the scoping of the project, we assigned a specific user story to each project
                            member to work on. I decided to apply the Design Thinking method, because it's a very
                            flexible method where you can start with prototyping if needed and then go back to a
                            phase that normally would be explored earlier (e.g. empathizing). I predicted that I would
                            probably have to make POC's early on to explore the technical possibilities for my user
                            story so using Design Thinking would be a safer option than the less flexible Waterfall
                            method for example.</p>

                          <p>PSV is a Dutch sports club and is mainly known as a football club. PSV wants to offer its
                            fans
                            and followers a good and relevant experience on every device and at any time. PSV currently
                            has
                            a website and two native apps to provide this.</p>

                          <p>Technological developments are moving fast and there are now countless possibilities for
                            setting up digital platforms. Setting up and maintaining a custom-built app
                            requires a relatively large amount of work and investment, because you have to develop
                            everything separately for android and ios. At the same time, the possibilities of mobile
                            websites are increasing. This all lead PSV to wonder how PSV can best organise its digital
                            platforms with regard to what they want to offer fans and followers.</p>

                            future-proof way. PSV originally wanted to let us research what technologies a new PSV app
                            should use. In addition, we (the project group) saw an opportunity to also research and
                            redesign some of its most
                            attractive/valuable features/concepts so that more value could be added to the PSV app in

                          <p>While waiting for meetings with PSV to update the project plan, we were doing
                            research on the current situation. I did literature research on what entities the
                            architecture of PSV's
                            media platforms consisted of. This would help give us an overview on what could be improved

                          <p>
                            The new user story became: "As a PSV fan I want to receive notifications that give a more
                            clear context when something
                            happens that's related to a (PSV football) game so that I can keep up with what's happening

                            PSV's app. The main question was to research what the notifications system looks like,
                            meaning how it works on a technical level and what it
                            looks like from the user's perspective. I learned what design was used to display
                            notifications and the notification settings by using the app for several weeks. This gave me
                            a good understanding of the user experience and how much the notification system contributes

                              score apps</a> that were popular and had good reviews. This way I could compare the

                            systems with PSV's notifications system and see how other apps create immersion/atmosphere
                            through the use of notifications. The goal, therefore, is to understand how other football
                            apps create more immersion/atmosphere around games for their users through the use of

                            app. I researched what the functionalities and best practices of Flutter's notification
                            capabilities are by applying desktop research and the literature study method.</p>

                          <p>From this research I concluded that using the 'flutter_local_notifications' package
                            combined with the 'FlutterFire' functionalities would be the most useful. Both offer
                            the same notification customizations like giving a notification a title, paragraph, sound,
                            image and a schedule which can potentially help create more immersion.</p>

                            Figma was used to create the designs.
                            I started wireframing so that I could quickly decide what type of layout was needed and what
                            information the screens/pages would need to contain.
                            When I had my wireframes ready, I started creating a high-fidelity prototype based on the
                            wireframes. This meant adding colors, fonts, effects and interactivity.
                            During the wireframing and high-fidelity process I applied basic design
                            principles/guidelines and the branding guidelines
                            of PSV.
                            The basic principles/guidelines were; menu layouts, icons, content alignment and content
                            management.
                            The applied branding guidelines were; typography, color palette, icons.

                          <p>While I was designing I began thinking about what would needed to be tested. Of course the
                            main goal of the user story was to create more immersion for PSV fans through notifications,
                            so I made a <a class="txt-link" target="_blank"
                              href="https://rickvwijk1.github.io/rvwijk_portfolio/modals/semesterSix/designTesting">test
                              plan</a> to be able to see if the design I created would create more immersion.
                            Unfortunately I was not able to get all the resources in time to carry out the test plan. In
                            my test plan I wanted to make a prototype that would simulate the current notification
                            system of PSV and compare it to my own designed notification system prototype. Sadly, I
                            needed to spare time for finishing the high-fidelity prototype and transfering the project
                            to the client correctly.</p>

                            We figured it was best to create a well-organized folder in which we would include the most
                            valuable research and a 'delivery/transfer' document. This document contained references to
                            where they could find specific research in the folder, the link to our Figma designs, link
                            to the GitHub organization and finally our advice to PSV with a conclusion and
                            recommendations.
                            This folder was handed to PSV in an email after we presented our findings at TQ.

                    <p>Looking back at the project I must say I'm happy about our process as a group. The start was
                      rough, because
                      the initial assignment wasn't 100% fit ICT & Media Design students. However, after a lot of
                      discussing with the client we agreed on a scoping that was a bit different. From then on we
                      applied our expertise and kept a good communication going with the client. The communication
                      within the group was good, but could have been better. For example, a few times project members
                      failed to
                      show up for the weekly Monday stand-up, because they forgot it was planned (despite it being
                      scheduled in MS
                      Teams). Next time I will send reminders on Sunday or advise my project members to set a reminder.

                      understanding the metaverse. For the second assignment we each made a metaverse avatar that
                      represents ourselves, and as final assignment we made a group photo of the avatars, discussed
                      how we created our avatars and what our joint opinion of the metaverse is.</p>

                      research on the clients to understand what products/services they offered and then writing down
                      metaverse ideas on a whiteboard that could improve those products/services.
