              <p><b>Problem/opportunity</b></p>
              <p>Technological developments are moving fast and there are now countless possibilities for setting up
                digital platforms. Setting up and maintaining a custom-built app requires a relatively large amount of
                work and investment, because you have to develop everything separately for android and ios. At the same
                time, the possibilities of mobile websites are increasing. This all led PSV to wonder how PSV can best
                organise its digital platforms with regard to what they want to offer fans and followers.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
              <p><b>Goals</b></p>
              <p>In the debriefing meeting we mainly listened to what the client had to say. PSV told us that
                developing and maintaining their website and apps costs a lot of money. Mainly their iOS and Android
                apps which are developed by a third party. They would like a cheaper, future-proof solution to bring PSV
                fans the
                content & functions they need.</p>

              <ol class="list">
                <li>Worked on everything that's in the project plan together with Dary van Sleeuwen. The rest of the
                  team helped formulate the questions and design challenge.</li>

              <p>Based on the information from the debriefing, me and Dary, created the first version of the project
                plan. When we were defining the project plan, we began to doubt whether this assignment was fiting for
                ICT & Media Design students since the client specifically asked for a cheaper technical solution and
                nothing that had something to do with users.</p>
              <p>We arranged two more meetings with PSV to see if we could reformulate the assignment and define the
                scope. In this meeting PSV told us that they were busy concepting new features for the app, like being
                able to scan tickets, order food during a game and more. They didn't want us to work on these
                features, but we suggested that we would do technical research and also design the features PSV were
                working on so that they could perhaps draw inspiration from our ideas/designs. PSV agreed and so we
                adjusted the project plan one last time.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="text">
              <p>We had a tough time formulating a main question and design challenge that included the technical aspect
                of the project and the app design aspect. This resulted in two main questions at first:</p>
              <i>How can we make sure the PSV app is not a copycat of the PSV website and has its own value?</i>
              <i>How can we make the PSV app future-proof and cost efficient?</i>
            </div>

            <div class="text">
              <p><b>Main question</b></p>
              <p>After a lot of thinking and reformulating, the final main question was formulated:</p>
              <i>How can we make the PSV app unique and valuable so that PSV supporters will find the app useful?</i>
              <p>As you can see the technical part was left out. The reason for this is that we formulated sub questions
                for which we would research what technologies would be most efficient if PSV were to make a new
                app.</p>

                <p>It was difficult to get the main question/design challenge/scoping right. After each meeting with the
                  client, we slowly understood the scoping better and better. I advised the client to not only look at
                  the technical aspect, but also to look at how to increase the value of the PSV app by letting us
                  research what features the target audience (actually) needs. I told the client that this is what
                  we as ICT & Media Design students excel in and that it's mandatory for us to do more user research.
                  The client understood this and agreed to adding this to the scope.
