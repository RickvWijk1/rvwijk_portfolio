                <p><b>Field research was applied,</b> because it will help find inspiration. In this research I looked
                  for existing football (score) apps that use live
                  match notification functionalities and possibly contribute to the immersion/atmosphere. The apps are
                  tested by downloading them and turning on notifications. Within a few days I gained enough information
                  to know what functions could be useful to the PSV app.</p>

                <i>Observations</i>
                <p>For about 3 weeks I received notifications of games. Something valuable I found is that the
                  Feyenoord app was posting realtime photo's of the game and lots of other visuals on a timeline. When
                  you would click on a notification it would bring you to that timeline so I felt like I was getting
                  good context on what was happening and enjoyed seeing images of the crowd enjoying themselves. Even
                  before and after the game they would post photos of players, fans, the stadium. If I was a Feyenoord
                  fan I would have most likely gotten very excited for the game so this could be a good addition for
                  improving the immersion of the PSV app.</p>
                <p>One of the other apps I tested, posted images in notifications which helps give more context which on
                  itself can increase the immersion. Most apps also offered notifications about when the match would
                  start, what the squad formation would be and when a penalty was given. Penalties are a great way to
                  build suspense since there's a high chance of a goal being scored.</p>
